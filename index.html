    <h2>Finding the bee: How visual load affects identification</h2>
    <p>You are invited to participate in an online experiment about how the level of visual load will affect the time taken to accurately identify an assigned visual stimuli.</p><br>
    
    <p>The research is conducted by Chester Yeo Chang Hong,  Jeremiah Jason Rusli, Joie Le Chin, and Lester Lee Jing Rong.
         They are current Bachelor of Psychological Science students at James Cook University Singapore, studying PY2112 in SP52 2022, and are conducting this survey for that module.</p>

    <p>You are eligible for this exercise if you are a James Cook University Singapore student studying PY2112 in SP52 2022.
                Participation is completely voluntary, and you can stop and leave this survey at any point if you need to just by closing the browser.</p>

    <p>This study will require you to locate and click on a visual stimuli. For each of the following slides shown, you will be required to click on the assigned visual stimuli to proceed to the next slide. Please do so as quickly as you can as your response time will be recorded for the purpose of this experiment.
         We estimate that it would take you about 5 minutes to complete this online experiment, which we invite you to complete at any time at your convenience. </p>
